<p>Below you’ll find predictions for the 2022 NFL season after simulating the remaining schedule 1,000x. The model I use is similar to that described by Wayne Winston, and popularized at Pro-Football-Reference, where victory for an NFL team in a given game can be approximated as a normal random variable with a mean of the “spread” and a standard deviation between 12-13 (using 12.7 based on Winston’s research).</p>

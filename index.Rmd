This website is a season-to-date look at how the NFL season has transpired, according to advanced analytics. We use play-by-play data from Ben Baldwin and Sebastian Carl's fantastic nflfastR package to tell the story of the 2024 season. nflfastR is an extension of the original work done by the nflscrapR team (Maksim Horowitz, Ron Yurko, and Sam Ventura).

Explore the various pages available using the links below.

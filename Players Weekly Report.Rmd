CPOE is simply the difference between a quarterbackâ€™s expected completion percentage and actual completion percentage. Expected completion percentage is a stat measuring the likelihood of a given pass being completed which factors in features like depth of target (air yards). It's a better measure of accuracy than traditional completion percentage because it takes into account the location of where passes are being thrown. -->

### EPA vs CPOE per dropback by team

The below is another way to look at quarterback efficiency using EPA and Completion Percentage Over Expectation (CPOE) as measures. CPOE is simply the difference between a quarterbackâ€™s expected completion percentage and actual completion percentage. Expected completion percentage is a stat measuring the likelihood of a given pass being completed which factors in features like depth of target (air yards). It's a better measure of accuracy than traditional completion percentage because it takes into account the location of where passes are being thrown.

Here we focus on quarterback play only as the QB position is the most valuable position on the field. As the quarterback goes, the team goes.

## Rushing Performance

The below shows a rusher's success rate vs his total EPA gained on runs this season.

```{r, echo = FALSE}

         ) %>% #Change this No. later in the season
  ungroup() # always ungroup if you no longer need the grouping effect
